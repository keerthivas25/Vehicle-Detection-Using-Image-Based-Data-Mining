# Vehicle Detection System

This project focuses on detecting vehicles in road images using a fully manual, rule-based approach. Unlike traditional deep learning or OpenCV-based methods, all core image processing functions are implemented from scratch using **NumPy** and **PIL**. The goal was to understand and build the end-to-end vehicle detection pipeline without relying on any black-box libraries.

## Overview

The project implements a custom pipeline for detecting vehicles in road images. It uses fundamental image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and edge detectionâ€”all implemented manually without relying on external libraries like OpenCV. The pipeline also incorporates texture analysis and contour filtering to improve detection accuracy.

## Key Features

### Core Image Processing Functions
- **Manual Grayscale Conversion**: Convert RGB images to grayscale using NumPy.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Implement a custom Gaussian filter for noise reduction.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Detect edges and regions of interest using a manually implemented thresholding algorithm.

### Morphological Operations
- Custom implementations of:
  - **Opening**: Remove small noise objects.
  - **Closing**: Fill gaps in detected shapes.
  - **Dilation and Erosion**: Expand or shrink detected regions.

### Contour Detection and Filtering
- Identify contours using shape-based metrics:
  - **Area**: Filter out small or irrelevant regions.
  - **Aspect Ratio**: Focus on elongated shapes typical of vehicles.
  - **Extent**: Measure the compactness of detected shapes.
  - **Circularity**: Analyze how closely the shape resembles a circle.

### Texture and Edge Analysis
- **Texture Analysis**: Use the Laplacian operator to analyze texture patterns.
- **Edge Detection**: A manually implemented Canny edge detector to identify vehicle boundaries.

### Composite Vehicle Score
- Combine metrics such as shape, texture, and edge density to compute a confidence score for each detected vehicle.

### Output Visualization
- Generate an output image with:
  - Visual indicators (bounding boxes) around detected vehicles.
  - Confidence scores for each detection.
